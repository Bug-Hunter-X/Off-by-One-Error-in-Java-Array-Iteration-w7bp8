# Off-by-One Error in Java Array Iteration
This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over arrays. The error occurs when the loop condition incorrectly includes the index equal to the array's length, leading to an attempt to access an element beyond the array's bounds.

The `bug.java` file contains the code exhibiting the error. The `bugSolution.java` file provides a corrected version.
